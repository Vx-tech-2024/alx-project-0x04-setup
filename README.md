# alx-project-0x04-setup
This project series demonstrates different approaches to state management in React applications by building an interactive counter application. Starting with React’s built-in useState hook, we progressively implement more sophisticated state management solutions including Context API and Redux. The project showcases how to share state across multiple components and maintain application-wide data consistency.
